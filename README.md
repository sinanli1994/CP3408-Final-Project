## CP3408 Unity Project: The Cubic Adventure

## Game Concept
**The Cubic Adventure** is a 3D platform game inspired by a platforming type of video game,'Platformer'. The characteristics of this platform game are attributed as casual, single-player, adventurous, and easy-to-play. 

## Gameplay
Gameplay of **The Cubic Adventure** is simple and easy-to-understand. The **__objective__** of this game itself requires existing player to navigate a little blue cube to the defined destination while avoiding barriers and any self-moving red cube patrolling near the destination point. The entire interaction between player and the playing object (Blue Cube) is controllable with keypress up, down, left, and right. Player is allowed to adjust the playing object freely upon the landscape. The game will restart once the playing object goes beyond the boundary of the landscape or collides with the patrolling red cube.
